aur2ccr - 
	Pull information from AUR or Arch repos, and make source 
	packages that are ready for uploading to CCR.

	improve popopts function, to allow options to be used like '-ce';
	add ability to check if ${pkgname}-git exists in CCR/Chakra repos;
	add basic (grep-style) regex support for searching package names;
	improve/update the man page, aur2ccr(8);
	use local configuration (~/.aur2ccr) as well as global (/etc/aur2ccr);
	improve the function for grabbing package info from Arch repos; 
	speed up the pacman-output-grepping function (with perl?);
	add the ability to automatically upload packages to CCR (if possible);
