This script uses the information on converting Arch/AUR packages to CCR source packages from http://chakra-linux.org/wiki/index.php/How_to_upload_a_package_to_CCR_when_it_exists_on_Arch_or_Aur


Installation:
Before installing this package, please be sure you are using Chakra Linux.
This script was designed specifically for Chakra, and will not work on any 
other platform, including Arch Linux.

Installation for aur2ccr is simple. Just run:
  make
  sudo make install
 -- OR --
  ccr -S aur2ccr
This will install the script itself, the needed configuration files, and
the aur2ccr(8) man page. There is no need for a ./configure, as the script
only works on one platform: Chakra Linux.
