aur2ccr - 
	pull Arch packages from AUR or source files from Arch repos,
	and make source packages ready for uploading to CCR

Todo: add the ability to grab packages from Arch repos; 
	add better error checking for packages not in AUR or Arch repos;
	add ability to search for packages in AUR/Arch repos instead of just failing (see above); 
	add ability to grab *.src.tar.gz CCR files and put them all in one place;

This script uses the information on converting Arch/AUR packages to CCR source packages from 
http://chakra-linux.org/wiki/index.php/How_to_upload_a_package_to_CCR_when_it_exists_on_Arch_or_Aur
