aur2ccr - 
Pull information from AUR or Arch repos, and make source 
packages that are ready for uploading to CCR.

Todo: 
improve popopts function, to allow options to be used like '-ce';
major code cleanup, try to reduce by at least a couple hundred lines;
add optipkg() function to fix some easy errors in PKGBUILDs;
cannibalize packer and remove it as a dependency;
add -i option to install packages;
get aur2ccr ready for an eventual switch to akabei;
improve function for grabbing package info from Arch repos (perl); 
speed up the pacman-output-grepping function (with perl?);
find and fix bugs!

This script uses the information on converting Arch/AUR packages to CCR source packages from http://chakra-linux.org/wiki/index.php/How_to_upload_a_package_to_CCR_when_it_exists_on_Arch_or_Aur


Installation:
Before installing this package, please be sure you are using Chakra Linux.
This script was designed specifically for Chakra, and will not work on any 
other platform, including Arch Linux.

Installation for aur2ccr is simple. Just run:
  make
  sudo make install
 -- OR --
  ccr -S aur2ccr
This will install the script itself, the needed configuration files, and
the aur2ccr(8) man page. There is no need for a ./configure, as the script
only works on one platform: Chakra Linux.

In order to use the script, you may need to run: 
  sudo pacman -Sy abs awk base-devel ccr packer sed
This will install all the programs required by the script, as well as a 
few tools that are needed to compile most packages.
